In the past she has tried Claritin and Zotec. Both worked for a short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again 2 weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over the counter sprays but no prescription nasal scrays. She does. She does have asthma but does not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up medication. Her only medication current currently is also Tricycline and Allegra allergies. She has no known medical allergies. Objective vitals weight was �130 in blood pressure 1 two 7 / 78 HEENT. Her throat was mildly erythemic. Erythmatius without exit date. Nasal mucosa was erythmatius and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMS were clear neck, subtle without adenopathy. Lungs. Clear assessment, allergic rhinitis. Plan one. She will try her side attack instead of Allegra. Again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage, so that might be cheaper. Samples of Nasonex 2 sprays in each nostril given for three weeks. A prescription was written as well."

In the past she has tried Claritin and Zotec. Both worked for a short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again 2 weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over the counter sprays but no prescription nasal scrays. She does. She does have asthma but does not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up medication. Her only medication current currently is also Tricycline and Allegra allergies. She has no known medical allergies. Objective vitals weight was �130 in blood pressure 1 two 7 / 78 HEENT. Her throat was mildly erythemic. Erythmatius without exit date. Nasal mucosa was erythmatius and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMS were clear neck, subtle without adenopathy. Lungs. Clear assessment, allergic rhinitis. Plan one. She will try her side attack instead of Allegra. Again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage, so that might be cheaper. Samples of Nasonex 2 sprays in each nostril given for three weeks. A prescription was written as well."

In the past she has tried Claritin and Zotec. Both worked for a short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again 2 weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over the counter sprays but no prescription nasal scrays. She does. She does have asthma but does not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up medication. Her only medication current currently is also Tricycline and Allegra allergies. She has no known medical allergies. Objective vitals weight was �130 in blood pressure 1 two 7 / 78 HEENT. Her throat was mildly erythemic. Erythmatius without exit date. Nasal mucosa was erythmatius and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMS were clear neck, subtle without adenopathy. Lungs. Clear assessment, allergic rhinitis. Plan one. She will try her side attack instead of Allegra. Again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage, so that might be cheaper. Samples of Nasonex 2 sprays in each nostril given for three weeks. A prescription was written as well."

In the past she has tried Claritin and Zotec. Both worked for a short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again 2 weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over the counter sprays but no prescription nasal scrays. She does. She does have asthma but does not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up medication. Her only medication current currently is also Tricycline and Allegra allergies. She has no known medical allergies. Objective vitals weight was �130 in blood pressure 1 two 7 / 78 HEENT. Her throat was mildly erythemic. Erythmatius without exit date. Nasal mucosa was erythmatius and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMS were clear neck, subtle without adenopathy. Lungs. Clear assessment, allergic rhinitis. Plan one. She will try her side attack instead of Allegra. Again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage, so that might be cheaper. Samples of Nasonex 2 sprays in each nostril given for three weeks. A prescription was written as well."

Nasal mucosa was erythmatius and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMS were clear neck, subtle without adenopathy. Lungs. Clear assessment, allergic rhinitis. Plan one.

In the past she has tried Claritin and Zotec. Both worked for a short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over the counter sprays but no prescription nasal scrays. She does. She does have asthma but does not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up medication. Her only medication current currently is also Tricycline and Allegra allergies. She has no known medical allergies. Objective vitals weight was 130 in blood pressure 1 two 7 / 78 HEENT. Her throat was mildly erythemic. Erythmatius without exit date. Nasal mucosa was erythmatius and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMS were clear neck, subtle without adenopathy. Lungs. Clear assessment, allergic rhinitis. Plan one. She will try her side attack instead of Allegra. Again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage, so that might be cheaper. Samples of Nasonex 2 sprays in each nostril given for three weeks. A prescription was written as well."
